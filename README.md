Business Analysis Practice Portfolio

ðŸ”¹ Overview
This repository contains a collection of Business Analysis artifacts I created as part of my learning and practice. Each topic demonstrates different BA skills such as Activity Diagrams, State Diagrams, Functional Requirement Documents (FRD), Use Cases, User Stories, and Test Cases.
Rather than one large project, these files showcase multiple real-world scenarios (login, user registration, insurance, recurring payments, etc.) where I applied BA methods individually.

Activity Diagrams (e.g., Login process)
State Diagram (Application state transitions)
Functional Requirement Document (FRD)
Use Cases (Login, Tax Payment, Insurance Login, etc.)
User Stories (Registration, Delete Recurring Payment, Consolidate Account)
Test Cases (Login validation and workflows)

ðŸ”¹ Tools Used
Microsoft Word / Excel
MS Visio / Diagramming Tools
